## Astro Bot

Astro Bot is **one of my favourite video games, ever**. I picked it up in the end of 2024, and played through 2025. I still play from time to time. Family friendly too.

You play as Astro, a small robot that's on a mission to rescue all of their friends and find parts to fix their spaceship, a PlayStation 5. 

Throughout the game you meet various attachments that lets you do different things, like frog gloves that springs your punch, or monkey hands that lets you grab and climb. You run around and jump on platforms, solve puzzles, and bonk peculiar enemies and bosses. Oh and along the way you collect little bots and secrets hidden throughout the game world. It's a super creative game made with a lot of heart and attention to detail.

Astro Bot is playable on PlayStation 5.

- [ ] Play Astro Bot.

I included the checkbox above, because I just managed to make it interactable. You can check and uncheck it!

Now I'm curious if I can make it so that you can write your own checklist, and check it off as you go. That would be fun! Maybe I'll make a tiny to do app.

## Dredge

Dredge is a cosmic horror fishing adventure game with a dark twist. You play as a fisherman who has to catch fish and explore the ocean, but as you go deeper, you encounter strange and eerie creatures, and get pulled deeper into the misadventure of the fisherman you've replaced. Featuring a hand drawn art style and haunting atmosphere that pulls you in.

During most of my playthrough, I sat on the edge of my couch, gripping the controller tightly while navigating through the dark waters. My ex girlfriend laughed at me as I jumped around and yelled at the game. Dredge is a mix of relaxing fishing and intense moments of getting away.

If I had to pick one thing I enjoyed the most in Dredge, I'd say the inventory management. It's slot based, so you have to carefully choose which equipment and items to bring with you on your trips. It adds an extra layer of strategy to the game.

Dredge is playable on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X and S, PC, iOS, and Android.

I'll add more later.
