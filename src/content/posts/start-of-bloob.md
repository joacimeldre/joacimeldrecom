## Bloob

What's a bloob? It's a blob made of jelly. A bloob can have bloobs inside of itself.

## Game design notes

The list below is copy paste from my notes, it's rough. I just want to get it down on the page. I can always edit and refine later.

- Jelly plattformer.
- Bloob starts with 1 bloob. Tutorial to learn how to use it.
  - Jump or dash (any direction) uses bloob.
  - Bloob regenerate over time spent on ground.
  - Find 1 more bloob to learn jump & dash.
    - Or *jump jump dash*, or *dash jump dash*, or *jump jump dash jump dash*.
  - I'll see how many bloobs I need to make the game fun and interesting.
  - All bloobs required to find *all the secrets*.
- Get to end of level.
  - Level has multiple endings?
  - Level checkpoints.
  - Get key to door.
    - Door can have multiple locks, each lock requires a key.
- Travel?
- Screen move from map to map. Locked camera.
- Bloob dies from environment.
  - Hazards: spike (jelly don’t like), hole (maybe secret, probably respawn).
  - Modifier: ice (fast, slippery), sand (slow, sinking).
- No enemies.
- No text.
- No score, only time.
- Easter eggs.
- Secrets: palettes, music?
- Bosses? Maybe not, maybe just fun levels.

## Next steps

Get a playable prototype going in PICO-8. I have no idea how PICO-8 works, so I'll be learning as I go. I'll start with the basics, and then add more features and mechanics as I go.

- Make sprites for bloob and dungeon. Keep it simple, just rectangles for now.
- Make test map.
- Make bloob move, jump, and dash.
- Make inside bloob mechanic. Start with 1, add more later.
- Make hazard (spike) that respawn bloob.

Then I'll build the game world and levels. Maybe some sort of overworld map? Maybe not. I'll see how it goes.
