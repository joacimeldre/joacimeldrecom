Icons are used to visually represent concepts, actions, figures, or objects in a compact and easily recognizable form. You can use icons in your product to make it easier to understand and visually appealing for whoever uses it.

## Inspiration

I get inspiration for icon design by life around me. Nature, human made objects, and other random things on the internet.

Sometimes I sketch on paper and see what pops up. All of the icons in this post are made purely for the fun I get from creating them.

Other times fine people ask me to design icons for their thing. Sometimes they know what they want, then we go from there.

## Tools

I use a Copic Multiliner pen, chunky gritty paper, and [Procreate](https://procreate.com/ "Procreate is an app for raster drawing on iPad") to sketch icon ideas. And I use [Figma](https://figma.com/ "Figma is a web application for prototyping with vector graphics and allows for easy collaboration") to finalize the icon designs.
