I'm a visual thinker. If you say "glorbulorp", I see *glorbulorp* in my head, in three dimensional space. I can grab and rotate to view another angle, or zoom in and out to view details. I can even remove or add more things to *glorbulorp*, like a party hat. It's fun and exhausting to think like this.

My intention with this website is to write down my thoughts, kind of as they happen, I try to just let it go, with little editing. To write more like me as my head goes. Mostly for myself, like a journal.

Perhaps fun for others to discover, and maybe learn something from. *Whoo!* Maybe *Whee?*

## Small code and video game detour

Lately I've rediscovered code, early in my life (I was 7 years old with access to a MS-DOS computer) I attempted to code a video game, but I gave up somewhere along the way when it didn't do what I wanted it to do. And everything was text! Code isn't visual, that takes a while for me to process, and definitely when said text doesn't make.. sense? I'm in an existential quarrel with myself, because my work require me to understand and write a small amount of `real code`, so I'm doing the *everything all at once* method to learn. I'm jamming everything in and shutting my flaps to see what stays.

I'm learning **Python** and (maybe) **Lua** by making video games.

In Python I'm making *Stable* together with a colleague. He's coding, I'm arting and coding tiny bits, together we're moving the game along. Stable is a game where you sort blocks into boxes, there's also a creature that eats, and bombs! It's currently in an early playable stage, with a lot to be done before it's playable.

In Lua (PICO-8) I'm making *Bloob* on my own. *Bloob* is a *dungeons & jellies* video game, where you move a blob made of jelly (not a human being made of jelly like me, see footer) that wants to escape the dungeon to get to the land of jellies. It's in the *Joacim has no idea what he's doing stage* where there's mostly thoughts, words, and sketches. Nothing playable yet. It's a comfortable place to be, and I need to get a playable prototype going.

Long story about one thing, leading into another thing, and then coming back to itself.

Anyway.

## Back to my website

I previously used Google Sites to write and host my website. It was super restrictive, I couldn't format and style the web pages how I wanted them to look and feel. And I didn't learn much from simply publishing through a content management system.

This website is another adventure in learning, so far it's using **MD**, **JSX**, **Astro**, **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The possibilities feel almost endless, I can make the website look and feel however I want, and add whatever features I want. It's fun to learn how to use these tools, and to make something with them. I've already learned a lot.

I make sure to always find time to do personal projects. At least 15 minutes every day. My ongoing projects are [fun icons](/posts/fun-icons) and Miu the cat.

Once in a while fine people [send me an email](mailto:hei@joacimeldre.com) and ask me to make icons, a logo, or an app prototype for them. I like that. Get in touch if you want to work together, or say hi.

I'm not going anywhere with this post. It's just exciting to have a place where I feel loose and free to write whatever I want, and not feel any pressure of making or writing a post this way or that for someone on some social media platform to look at for a second or fifty, then scroll past. Somewhere I probably don't own what I post myself, and the platform owners can do with the content as they please whenever they want.

I don't want that. So I'm just gonna write whatever I want on here, and I'll have fun doing it.

## Have fun, play video games

That's a wrap for my first post. I'm off on my adventure in *The Last Guardian*! That's a video game. Yes, I like video games!
