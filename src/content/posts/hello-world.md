I'm a visual thinker. If you say "glorbulorp", I see *glorbulorp* in my head, three dimensional and all. Rotate to view another angle, zoom in and out. I can even remove or add stuff to *glorbulorp*. It's fun and exhausting to think like this.

My intention with this website is to write down my thoughts, kind of as they happen, I try to just let it go, with little editing. To write more like me as my head goes. Mostly for myself, like a journal. Perhaps it can be fun for others to discover, and maybe learn something from. *Whoo!* Maybe *Whee?*

## Detour about code and video games

Lately I've rediscovered code, early in my life (I was 7 years old with access to a computer with MS-DOS) I attempted to code a video game, but I gave up somewhere along the way when it didn't do what I wanted it to do. And everything was text! Code isn't visual, that takes a while for me to process, and definitely when said text doesn't make.. sense? I'm in an existential quarrel with myself, because my work require me to understand and write a small amount of `real code`, so I'm doing the *everything all at once* method to learn. It's not great, but I'm jamming everything in and shutting my flaps to see what stays.

I'm learning **Python** and (maybe) **Lua** by making video games.

In Python I'm making *Stable* together with a colleague. He's coding, I'm arting and coding tiny bits, together we're moving the game along. Stable is a game where you sort blocks into boxes, there's also a creature that eats, and bombs! It's currently in an early playable stage, with a lot of content to go before it's finished.

In Lua (PICO-8) I'm attempting to make *Bloob* on my own. *Bloob* is going to be a *dungeons & jellies* game, where you move a blob made of jelly (not a human being made of jelly like me, see footer) that wants to escape the dungeon to get to the land of jellies. It's in the *Joacim has no idea what he has got himself into stage* where there's thoughts, words, and sketches. Nothing playable yet. It's a comfortable place to be, perhaps too comfortable.

Long story about one thing, leading into another thing, and then coming back to itself.

Anyway.

## Back to my website

I previously used Google Sites to write and host my website. It was super restrictive, I couldn't format and style the web pages how I wanted them to look and feel. And I didn't learn much from simply publishing through a content management system.

This website is another adventure in learning, so far it's using **MD**, **JSX**, **Astro**, **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.

I make sure to always find time to do personal projects. At least 15 minutes every day. My ongoing projects are [fun icons](/posts/fun-icons) and Miu the purple cat.

Once in a while fine people [send me an email](mailto:hei@joacimeldre.com) and ask me to make icons, a logo, or an app prototype for them. I like that.

I have no idea where I'm going with this post. It's exciting to have a place to write whatever I want, and not feel any pressure of making or writing a post this way or that for someone on some social media platform to look at for a second or fifty, then scroll past. Where I probably don't even own what I post myself, and the platform owners can do with the content as they please whenever they want.

I don't want that. So I'm just gonna write whatever I want on here, and I'll have fun doing it.

## Website stack

This website is built on several technologies to be able to float into your eyes and/or ears, like it's doing now.

* [Astro](https://astro.build/ "Astro is a modern static site builder based on JavaScript.") for generating the site.
* Markdown for writing blog posts.
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/ "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.") for styling.
* [React](https://react.dev/ "React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.") for building components.
* [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/introducing-jsx "JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML.") for writing components.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/ "GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.") for storing code and other files.
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/ "Vercel is a platform for frontend frameworks and static sites, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.") for deployment and hosting the build.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/ "Cloudflare provides content delivery network services, DDoS mitigation, Internet security, and distributed domain name server services.") for domain management and email forwarding.

## Have fun

That's a wrap for my first blog post. I'm off on my adventure in *The Last Guardian*! That's a video game. Yes, I like video games!
